# pomodoro.sh

A simple pomodoro "app" written in bash. 

[Pomodoro.sh](pomodoro.sh) is also a nice domain name, but I don't really want to pay **$35** for it :D

# HOW TO

- clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/Kiailandi/pomodoro.sh`
- cd into the repo with `cd pomodoro.sh`
- make the script executable `chmod +x pomodoro`
- run it with `./pomodoro <focus time length> <break time length>` (*default values are **25 mins** focus and **5 [1/5 of focus] mins** break*)
